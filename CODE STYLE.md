Code Style
==========

All details must be added on best code forms to better team understanding.

All layouts and drawables that are common to all devices can be moved to *default* folder.

Others that are to be customized can be divided to different folders -

* ldpi
* mdpi
* hdpi
* xhdpi

General
-------

Before upload -

1. Add basic comments on modules and files to explain working, arguments and use.
2. Perform Source formatting with a tool or manually to allow Readability.
3. Check dependencies and main outputs.
4. Naming conventions would be preferred.

Tags
----

Certain tags are used in comments to assist in indexing common issues. Such tags are commonly syntax-highlighted within text editors and can be searched for with common programming tools, such as the Unix grep utility. Examples of tag conventions include:

* FIXME to mark potential problematic code that requires special attention and/or review.
* NOTE to document inner workings of code and indicate potential pitfalls.
* TODO to indicate planned enhancements.
* XXX to warn other programmers of problematic or misguiding code.

There is a risk that tags accumulate over time; it is advisable to include the date and the tag owner in the tag comment to ease tracking.

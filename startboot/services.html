				<p>"MIST is the only one of its kind institute which has been specially designed for the changing trends and pattern required from a international medical graduate in achieving his dream come true without wasting his precious time and money. "</p>
                    <p>MIST is a cohesive work force of leading educationists having a vast experience in teaching international and national medical graduates. The teaching faculties and the management at Mist comprises of individuals who have themselves experienced and mingled with the students in their respective countries. After a live experience with the students in their hostel, college, kitchen and the environment, we have analysed the hardships of the students which they have faced outside India. At a tender age of 18, the Indian petals have started adapting to conditions where they have to learn a different language, different pattern of teaching, cook for themselves, lead a responsible social life and above all have a humane attitude towards life. Believe it or not, we have drawn a conclusion that these petals become blossoming flowers when they come back to India. We strongly believe the personality of these students is much superior to many of those completing their education in India itself. With such a strong belief, further what is required is the right guidance and approach in clearing the screening test which is what we are committed to provide, and it does not end here….<strong> OUR AIM IS TO ACHIEVE A QUALITY LIVING AND A BECOME A BETTER HUMAN BEING EVEN AFTER CLEARING THE 1st STEP IN INDIA.“BE POSITIVE ALWAYS— AND BEFORE SAYING NO, SAY I WILL TRY AND THEN GIVE IT YOUR BEST”</strong></p>
